## "A Practical Guide to Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras"

## Setup

Prerequisite: Python

To use Jupyter Notebooks on your computer - please follow the [installation instructions](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
Note: Anaconda installation is recommended if you are not familiar with other Python package management systems. 

### Guided Steps

* Install dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

* Run jupyter notebook

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Agenda

### 0) Don't be scared of Linear Regressions - it does not "byte"!.. Basic Terminology:
- Linear regression Notebook
- 🐵🧠 (plot) What is neuron? What is activation function?

### 1)  👀 Computer Vision:

- ✍🏻 Handwritten digits (MNIST) recognized with fully connected neural network
- 📸 (plot) One-hot encoding
- 👁 Information theory and representation: MNIST Principal Component Analysis
- 🙈 (plot) Fully connected vs. convolutional neural network
- 📷 (plot + Notebook) Convolutions, pooling, dropouts
- 🛒 (plot) Transfer learning and different topologies
- 🎨 Style transfer
- 🧐 (Convolutional) Neural Network attention - ML explainability

### 2) Text Analytics - Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- 🤬 Toxicity demo
- 📝 (plot) How to represent text as numbers? Text vectorization: one-hot encoding, tokenization, word embeddings
- 🙊 IMDB movies review dataset prediction with hot-encoding in Keras
- 🤯 Word embeddings and [Embedding Projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org/)
- 🗒 Embedding vs hot-encoding and Fully Connected Neural Network for IMDB
- 📒 Can LSTM guess the author?

### 3) Can Robot juggle? Reinforcement Learning:
- 🎭 (plot) Actors and environment
- Reinforcement learning

### 4) Operationalization, aka "10 ways to put your slapdash code into production..."
- (plot) Data - Training - Deployment aka MLOps or CI/CD for Data Scientists

### 5) Summary
- Quick recap what we learned so far
